create python virtual environment

build and test ?

purpose errors may include: repetition, long classes/functions, etc

is not needed to create more tests

2 easy points in part part 1, section 3

not long comments

avoid duplication, create functions

make sure a function does only one thing

small commits

upload an xml with the correct execution of the test cases to github

singleton is the solution to the problem of multiple objects with the same configuration (default)

from easiest and smallest refactors (names) to the bigger ones (shorten functions)

refactoring guru (recommended website to be guided)

it's good practice to create object methods from the operations made inside the object

pyb run_unit_tests to run all tests

orderManager should only have 3 functions (the rest should be independent, for example creating other objects)

until next session (eliminate mysterious names, create methods for validations, move validations to the orderRequest and __ classes)

validations are just methods that only check if the data is correct (need to see the code)

create an attribute file (attribute.py), using the  abstract method decorator, in order to create a blueprint to create attribute validator files

repetition and validation is a 6/10, after that we need to decide if we want to create a class for storing the values of the class

if we have two functions too similar create a general one and make the precisions necessary.

get ready the attributes and at last one store
